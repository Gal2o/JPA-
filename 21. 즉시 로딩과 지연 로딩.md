- ### Member를 조회할 때, Team도 함께 조회해야 할까❓ <br><br> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35948339/144707233-5ff18af5-342d-47fa-a85d-85872ccd4746.png)
  - #### Member와 Team이 연관관계 매핑되어 있는데, Member만 사용하고 싶은 상황이다
-------
- ### 지연 로딩 LAZY를 사용해서 프록시로 조회
  - #### 지연 로딩 안했을 시
  ``` java
      Member m = em.find(Member.class, member1.getId());
      
      // 결과 값
      select
        member0_.MEMBER_ID as MEMBER_I1_0_0_,
        member0_.team_TEAM_ID as team_TEA3_0_0_,
        member0_.USERNAME as USERNAME2_0_0_,
        team1_.TEAM_ID as TEAM_ID1_1_1_,
        team1_.name as name2_1_1_ 
      from
          Member member0_ 
      left outer join
          Team team1_ 
              on member0_.team_TEAM_ID=team1_.TEAM_ID 
      where
          member0_.MEMBER_ID=?
  ```
  - #### Team과 연관매핑이므로 모두 가져온다.

  - ### em.find 시점에 Member, Team 한꺼번에 가져온다.
--------
- ### ⭐ 프록시와 `즉시로딩` 주의
  - #### `가급적 지연 로딩만 사용 (특히 실무에서)`
  - #### `즉시로딩`을 사용하면, 예상하지 못한 SQL이 발생한다.
    - #### 테이블이 많은 연관관계를 가진다면, 전체가 Join 되서 쿼리가 엄청나게 길어지고 성능도 좋지 않ㄴ다.
  - #### `즉시로딩`을 사용하면 `JPQL`에서 `N+1 문제`를 일으킨다.
    ``` java
        Member m = em.find(Member.class, member1.getId());
    ```
    - #### em.find는 영속성 컨텍스트가 PK를 사용하기 때문에, 문제를 발생시키지 않는다.

    - #### JPQL은 쿼리를 만들어서 사용하기 때문에

    ```
    - #### select * from Member로 Member를 가져오는 쿼리를 날리면, <br><br> member1 - team, member2 - team2 연관된 모든 값을 가져온다
    - #### `처음 실행한 쿼리 1` + `추가 만들어진 쿼리 N`
  -------
  - #### 모든 전략을 LAZY로 만들어서 사용하기
  - #### `JPQL을 사용한다면,` LAZY 전략 + fetch join을 사용한다.
    ``` java
        List<Member> members = em.createQuery("select m from Member m join fetch m.team", Member.class)
                            .getResultList();
